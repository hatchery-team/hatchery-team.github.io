    <h2 id="what">1. What?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm 24yo guy, looking for a small isolated <b>team</b> to build a strong long-lasting <b>relationships</b> and a common vision as a basement for our <b>future projects</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of a few nerds, living together and spending most of their time developing themselfes, their relationships, and their shared philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            They <b>try</b> together, <b>fail</b> together, and <b>rise</b> together after falling.</br>
            They <b>share</b> everything, <b>talk</b> honestly about deep feelings and try to do more so that others have less.</br>
            They spend days <b>searching</b>, reading, and watching; then spend nights <b>thinking</b>, discussing, and sharpening their vision.</br>
            They <b>synchronize</b> tastes and opinions and make numerous <b>compromises</b>, changing each other until they can understand each other <b>without words</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, maybe after months or years, they start <b>doing</b>. If you believe in the power of one, imagine the power of <b>a team</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll tell me it's utopia. I'll show you it's not.
        </p>

    <h2 id="why">2. Why?</h2>
    <h3 id="why-search">2.1. Because people are worth the trouble to look for</h3>
        <p>
            I believe <b>deep relationships</b> are the most important component of our human happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about your love partner and best friends.<br>
            How and why did you meet?<br>
            I bet it was a fluke - you just appeared in the same place doing the same thing for some time and either clicked immediately or get used to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's what I call <b>'naturally born'</b> relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            But at the same time, we have <b>unlimited</b> access to other people at cost of <b>nothing</b>.
            Try to calculate how many people of your age/profession/interest there are in your city.<br>
            In the country?<br>
            In the world?..<br>
            Then try to calculate your potential speed of getting to know a new person and you'll realize that <b>you</b> are the bottleneck, not the people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the high cost of relationships and low cost of getting to know another person, what if you try to do the intentional <b>'preparation work'</b>?<br>
            What if you think over the traits of your future mate <b>in advance</b>?<br>
            What if you start looking right people with the right methods in the <b>right places</b>?
        </p>
        <p>
            That's what I call <b>'artificially born'</b> relationships and that's what I'm going to build.
        </p>

    <h3 id="why-meaning">2.2. Because I want to share the meaning</h3>
        <p>
            The feelings that bring me the highest joy ever are the <b>shared</b> fatigue and honor after a tough victory, the <b>shared</b> bliss of Evrika, and the <b>shared</b> pain of loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without emotions being shared and intentions being completely understood, the achievements and effort lose all their meaning for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why work hard, why overcome yourself, if no one can really understand what you do?
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure, if you do something good, like cure a lot of people or invent something useful, many people will appreciate it and thank you.<br>
            But it's not enough for me. No <b>external gratitude</b> can replace the <b>inner one</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This inner gratitude, the <b>inner source of meaning</b> is the only thing I believe, but at the same time, I'm the only author of it. <b>Absurd</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The devastating feeling of being the only source of meaning cuts me open.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started the Hatchery to share that onus of inevitable, endless and continuous <b>labor of creation of meaning</b> with the same Sisyphus-s as me.
        </p>
        <p>
            After all, I don't want to get onto the mountain peak just to see that there is <b>no one else there</b>. 
            I want to share the path with someone with whom someday we could look back and to whom I could tell: "Yes, <b>we</b> did it".
        </p>
        
    <h3 id="why-efficient">2.3. Because it's efficient</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to go fast, go <b>alone</b>, if you want to go far, go <b>together</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve something really valuable, you should arrange your projects like <b>stairs</b> - the next projects should use the previous one as the foundation.
            But what if you <b>reuse</b> not only your personal experience but the <b>team</b> as well?
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about your teamwork <b>growing together</b> with your experience and the complexity of your projects, allowing you to implement more and more complex staff.<br>
            Everything you developed together stays with you, <b>outlives</b> the projects, and is reused in the new ones.<br>
            Watch and enjoy the slow, step-by-step <b>evolution</b> of your common speed of understanding, trust, and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing your mates will not change encourages you to focus long-term. 
            You start investing time in <b>joint growth</b>.
            If someone fails, others help him to get out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Commitment in relationships creates a solid <b>foundation</b> for future skyscrapers.
        </p>

    <h2 id="do">3. What exactly will we do?</h2>
        <p>
            The exact steps depend on our line-up and discussions. But generally, it would be the next four things.
        </p>

    <h3 id="do-relationships">3.1. Develop relationships</h3>
        <p>
            We will intentionally work on getting used to each other.<br>
            We will settle together.<br>
            We will distance ourselves from other relationships.<br>
            We will spend hours in deeply honest conversations about our past, present, and future.<br>
            We will talk sincerecly about our needs, fellings and fears.
            We will listen to each other.
            We will tread carefully on the slippery path of compromises.
        </p>
    <h3 id="do-mind">3.2. Open the mind</h3>
        <p>
            We will swallow a lot of books, films, podcasts, blogs, and opinions.<br>
            We will travel.<br>
            We will build many weak ties outside and come back to hatchery to share our findings.<br>
            We will share our work with others.<br>
            We will make a lot of different projects, changing our roles.<br>
            We will try different approaches to work and live.<br>
        </p>
    <h3 id="do-vision">3.3. Build common vision</h3>
        <p>
            We will align on the vision of life.<br>
            We will discuss about what is important, what is not and why.<br>
            We will think carefully what we want to do.<br>
            We will argue a lot.<br>
        </p>
    <h3 id="do-develop">3.4. Develop ourselves</h3>
        <p>
            We will research major self-development topics and test them on ourselves.<br>
            Philosophy. 
            Sport. 
            Nutrition. 
            Psychology. 
            Task management. 
            Art. 
            Programming. 
            Languages.
        </p>

    <h2 id="me">4. More about me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm weak, imperfect and fearful.
            I'm reflective, ambitious, selfless, lonely, and impulsive.
            I have average intellect, average attractiveness, average health.
            I spend hours thinking every day.
            I do sports every day.
            Programmer.
            Minimalist.
        </p>

    <h2 id="you">5. More about you</h2>
    <p>Here is the general "good enough" checklist I use:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Hatchery project (or whatever name) is your current <b>life goal</b>.</li>
        <li>I noticed three traits in you: <b>reflexivity</b>, <b>ambition</b>, and <b>selflessness</b>.</li>
        <li>We just <b>clicked</b> and I like you.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Being <b>reflexive</b> means that you are used to constantly thinking about what, why and how you think. It paralyzes until it is tamed, I know.<br>
        Being <b>ambitious</b> means you always want more than you can do and tend to make bold decisions quickly.<br>
        Being <b>selfless</b> means believing in your mediocrity and insignificance; minimalism and a tendency to give more than you take in teamwork. To be the guy who usually gives way and endures until he really needs something.
    </p>

    <p>Here are other traits I that would appreciate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attemps to organize your knowledge and memory: diary, pkm, blog.</li>
        <li>Loneliness, avoidance of crowds, noisy parties, and group training.</li>
        <li>You enjoy physical activity.</li>
        <li>You are a programmer / digital nomad.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="contact">6. Contacting</h2>
    <p>
        So I'm 'hiring' now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Email me at hatchery.team@protonmail.com for any reason.
    </p>
    <p>I always respond.</p>
